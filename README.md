# Stand - a tools component library

_Find what you need on the (news)stand!_

Stand is component library for Guardian editorial tools. It is co-located within flexible-content as Composer is expected to be the main consumer of the UI components within Stand. But any editorial tool should be able to make use of the components as an npm package - `@guardian/stand` - and developers should feel comfortable contributing.

## Setup

- Run `./setup.sh` in the project root (flexible-content) directory to set up pnpm, install dependencies, and build the project.

## Tasks

- Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies.
- Run `pnpm build` to build, this makes any changes available to flexible-frontend
- Run `pnpm storybook` to run Storybook
