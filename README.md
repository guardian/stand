# Stand - a tools component library

Stand is component library for Guardian editorial tools. It is co-located within flexible-content as Composer is expected to be the main consumer of the UI components within Stand. But any editorial tool should be able to make use of the components as an npm package - `@guardian/stand` - and developers should feel comfortable contributing.

## Tasks

- Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies.
- Run `pnpm build` to build, this makes any changes available to flexible-frontend
